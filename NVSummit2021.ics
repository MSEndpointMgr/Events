DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nestori Syynimaa\n\nAzure AD is used by Microsoft Offi
	ce 365 and over 2900 third-party apps. Although Azure AD is commonly regar
	ded as secure\, there are known security issues regarding to identity fede
	ration\, pass-through authentication\, and seamless single-sign-on. \n\nIn
	 this session\, using AADInternals toolkit\, I will demonstrate how to cre
	ate backdoors\, impersonate users\, and bypass MFA. Methods for detecting 
	rogue behaviour are also introduced.\n\nThe purpose of this session is to 
	raise awareness of the information security\, the importance of the princi
	ple of least privilege\, and the crucial role of on-prem security to cloud
	 security.\n\nhttps://2021.nordicvirtualsummit.com/SecDay1\n

	A) is mostly used to simplify the transition between Windows 10 versions. 
	With Desktop Analytics you easily get insights e.g. what applications migh
	t be problematic with the upgrade. Also\, the intelligent piloting guarant
	ees that the pilot group contains all the required assets. And you can dep
	loy Configuration Manager task sequences to the pilot & production groups 
	to do the actual upgrade.\n\nBut Desktop Analytics can do a lot more. With
	 it\, you see valuable information about Windows 10 security update status
	. Also\, it gives you information about the assets\, which is independent 
	of Configuration Manager inventory. Utilizing Log Analytics queries agains
	t Desktop Analytics data\, you can find interesting new info about your de
	vices and applications.\n\nIn this session\, you will learn how make the m
	ost of the data Desktop Analytics has collected from your environment! \n\

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jan Vidar Elven\n\nServerless Automation solutions lik
	e Logic Apps and Azure Functions can be valuable tools for automating IT p
	rocesses\, much like Power Automate Flows automate user processes. While F
	lows run under the context of the calling user\, Logic Apps and Azure Func
	tions runs as itself.  In this session we will look into how to add Azure 
	AD Authentication and Authorization to these solutions\, and how we can le
	t end users call them securely and protected by Azure AD.\n\nhttps://2021.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Gerry Hampson\n\nWindows Virtual Desktop allows you to
	 deploy and scale virtualized Windows desktops and apps on Azure. It can b
	e deployed in minutes and offers simplified management\, multi-session Win
	dows 10 and optimizations for Office 365 ProPlus. You can deploy VMs with 
	Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016. You can also use your own custom Window
	s 7 images. As an added bonus this includes free extended support for Wind
	ows 7 (extended security updates for three years). That's a no-brainer. Ge
	rry will take you through the process to get up and running.\n\nhttps://20
